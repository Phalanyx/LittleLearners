# üåü Educational Web App for Youths with Learning Disabilities üåü

## üß† Inspiration
Our project is an **_educational learning app_** designed to teach English through a **structured roadmap**, particularly targeting **youth and students with _learning disabilities_**. The app starts with the basics like alphabets and progresses to reading full sentences, breaking down the learning process into manageable levels.

Each level includes a variety of **mini-games** that engage multiple senses, using **visual and auditory cues** to help students understand and maintain their focus. When students successfully complete games, they are **rewarded with coins**, which they can use to buy **AI-generated books** that cater to their preferences. The app provides **continuous audio support** to help students when they get stuck, and it offers a _clear roadmap_ for the next steps in their journey.

## üéØ What Our Project Does
This **innovative educational learning app** is specifically designed to help youth, particularly those with learning disabilities, master the English language. It provides a **comprehensive, structured roadmap** starting with the basics, such as *alphabets*, and gradually progresses to more advanced topics like *reading full sentences*.

### Key Highlights:
- **Structured roadmap** guiding students step-by-step from basic to advanced English learning.
- **Multi-sensory engagement:** Using both visual and auditory cues for a richer learning experience.
- **Reward system:** Students earn _coins_ after completing games, which can be used to purchase **personalized AI-generated books**.
- **Motivational audio support**: Helps students who struggle, encouraging them to keep progressing.
- **Visually appealing, short attention span-friendly games** designed for accessibility.

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It
We built this project using **NextJS** and **React** for both the frontend and backend. We utilized **GPT-4**, **DALL-E 3**, and **Google's Web Speech API** to implement *AI-generated images, stories*, and *speech recognition* functionalities. To handle user data and in-game currency, we used **Prisma** with **SQLite** as our database.

We also developed an **Adobe Add-on** using **JavaScript**, which allows users to upload avatars via **React's built-in camera library**, offering a smooth, intuitive experience for avatar customization.
