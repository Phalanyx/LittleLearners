# üåü Educational Learning App for Youth with Learning Disabilities

## üß† Inspiration
Our project is an **_educational learning app_** designed to teach English through a **structured roadmap**, particularly targeting **youth and students with _learning disabilities_**. The app starts with the basics like alphabets and progresses to reading full sentences, breaking down the learning process into manageable levels.

Each level includes a variety of **mini-games** that engage multiple senses, using **visual and auditory cues** to help students understand and maintain their focus. When students successfully complete games, they are **rewarded with coins**, which they can use to buy **AI-generated books** that cater to their preferences. The app provides **continuous audio support** to help students when they get stuck, and it offers a _clear roadmap_ for the next steps in their journey.

## üéØ What Our Project Does
This **innovative educational learning app** is specifically designed to help youth, particularly those with learning disabilities, master the English language. It provides a **comprehensive, structured roadmap** starting with the basics, such as *alphabets*, and gradually progresses to more advanced topics like *reading full sentences*.

### Key Highlights:
- **Structured roadmap** guiding students step-by-step from basic to advanced English learning.
- **Multi-sensory engagement:** Using both visual and auditory cues for a richer learning experience.
- **Reward system:** Students earn _coins_ after completing games, which can be used to purchase **personalized AI-generated books**.
- **Motivational audio support**: Helps students who struggle, encouraging them to keep progressing.
- **Visually appealing, short attention span-friendly games** designed for accessibility.

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It
We built this project using **NextJS** and **React** for both the frontend and backend. We utilized **GPT-4**, **DALL-E 3**, and **Google's Web Speech API** to implement *AI-generated images, stories*, and *speech recognition* functionalities. To handle user data and in-game currency, we used **Prisma** with **SQLite** as our database.

We also developed an **Adobe Add-on** using **JavaScript**, which allows users to upload avatars via **React's built-in camera library**, offering a smooth, intuitive experience for avatar customization.

## üöß Challenges We Faced
This was our first hackathon experience, and with only 4 hours of sleep each night, we faced many challenges. One of the toughest tasks was working with **Adobe Express**. The process of building an add-on proved to be more complicated than we anticipated. With limited documentation, we had to go through a lot of trial and error to make the playground work with our code. But after hours of hard work, we finally succeeded, which felt like a huge victory! üéâ

At the start, we were _overambitious_. We had grand ideas that quickly became overwhelming. As we went deeper into the project, we had to **re-evaluate** what was realistic within the time constraints. While we scaled back some features, we made sure the final product was polished and practical.

## üöÄ What We Learned
We gained valuable lessons on the importance of **balancing ambition with practicality**. Though some features had to be cut, the experience taught us to focus on core functionalities and deliver quality. Additionally, we learned how to troubleshoot through trial and error, especially when working with new platforms like **Adobe Express**.

## üåà What's Next?
Our future goals include:
- **Expanding the game to support multiple languages** to reach a broader audience.
- **Adding more AI features** to make the app even more personalized and responsive.
- **Improving accessibility** to better serve students with diverse learning needs.

We believe this tool can be a game-changer for students, particularly those with special needs, offering them the support they deserve on their educational journey. With **literacy rates declining** and children with learning disabilities often lacking access to necessary resources, this app is designed to bridge the gap. 

Education is the foundation of opportunity, and we see this project as a way to give children the tools they need to thrive!
